                <h3>Overview</h3>
            </div>

            <p>Depression is not an uncommon condition that affects many individuals. In fact, 70% of those who commit suicide have reportedly been diagnosed with depression. The problem is that having to cope with depression alone is difficult. And even when receiving help from a counselor, some may still have trouble establishing a consistent support system outside in their daily lives, once again leaving them alone to manage thier condition. ReJournal was created to fill this gap.</p>

            <p>ReJournal grew out of our desire to help. We knew we couldn't replace professional counselors and therapists because they were still a necessary part of recovery and their expertise was irreplaceable. Instead we looked into recovery plans and techniques already used by individuals to see if we could enhance any of their tools. We found that while plans varied, the importance of reflection did not.<p>

            <p>We began by making a paper prototype of a journaling device. An important part of our process was trying to figure out how to differentate the device from existing journaling tools like apps. After receiving feedback from our peers and users, we iterated and fixed our flaws. This included correcting confusing icons as well as adding tools that users wanted but were not yet present in our design. This device eventually became ReJournal.</p>

            <p>ReJournal is a dedicated device for journaling that aims to help individuals diagnosed with depression with their recovery, particularly during times when they have less support such as between counseling sessions. ReJournal encourages users to reflect on how they are feeling and to write down what is on their mind and provides features to assist with reflection. Additionally, ReJournal aims to provide communication pipelines that users can utilize in their time of need, cultivating a consistent support system for users.</p>
